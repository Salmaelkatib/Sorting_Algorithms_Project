# Sorting_Algorithms_Project
The program compares a sorting algorithm with its asymptotic efficiency or compares different sorting algorithms with each other ,on line chart , to find 
which sorting algorithm has less running time and complexity , the 
included algorithms are ( Insertion sort , Merge sort , Heap sort , Quick sort , Bubble sort , 
Selection sort , Counting Sort ) .
